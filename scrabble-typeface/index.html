    Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of
    the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs
    are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to
    read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander
    makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the
    other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can
    remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband,
    Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job,
    money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now . .
