# Sin City (Action Graphic Novel)

Add short bursts of animation to a graphic novel. It is 100% responsive (SVG).

It autoscrolls to show each tab at the top of the page and cycles through to the next.

I would add the ability to toggle this behaviour in a later version.

I discuss this more in my post - [Make your own (interactive) graphic novel](https://www.roboleary.net/2021/07/14/make-your-own-graphic-novel.html).
