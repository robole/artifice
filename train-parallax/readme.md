## Train Parallax

Created for an article - [How to make an awesome horizontal parallax animation](https://roboleary.net/css/2020/11/17/parallax-animation.html).

This version runs infinitely. I describe in the article how to prepare the image to enable this.

To see it in action:
- You can check out the [codepen](https://codepen.io/robjoeol/pen/KKMYdQP), or
- You can run the local dev server with `npm run dev`, and find it at <http://localhost:3000/train-parallax/index.html>.
