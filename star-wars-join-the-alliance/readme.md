# Join the Alliance (Star Wars)

Star Wars recruitment poster, sort of.

I wanted to experiment with text. I modified the outline of some of the characters with the form of some star wars rebel heroes. I wanted to see how this would look with a spacescape background. This is exploring the figure-ground relationship from gestalt theory.

I also wanted to see how an animation within text looked. This effect is created with a SVG mask. The light saber extends within the text. This might be a bit much in this instance, but I think it is a cool effect that can be used elsewhere.
