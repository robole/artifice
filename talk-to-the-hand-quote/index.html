      There is nothing wrong with the planet. The planet is fine ... been here 4
      1/2 billion years. We've been here, what, a 100,000 years, maybe 200,000.
      And we've only been engaged in heavy industry a little over 200 years. 200
      years versus 4 1/2 billion. And we have the conceit to think that somehow
      we're a threat? The planet isn't going away. We are.
