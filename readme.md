# Artifice

 **ar•ti•fice** *är′tə-fĭs* ►

    n.
    Deception or trickery.
    n.
    Something contrived or made up to achieve an end, especially by deceiving; a stratagem or ruse: synonym: wile.

This is home to some (art) experiments to improve my frontend trickery.

Each experiment is organised into a folder. If the folder has:
- A subfolder with the title "original" - I recreated the original artwork in here (with a smidge of artistic license).
- A subfolder with the title "remix" -  this is where I go off and create my own thing.
- If there is neither of these subfolders, it's likely to be my own creation.

To try out the experiments, you can install the dependencies and run a local dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Logo tilt

I wanted to try out a goofy idea. I wanted to animate a website’s logo so
that it would fall over when you scroll down, and right itself when you
scroll up. In particular, I wanted the logo to be a head or have a
cartoonish look.

## Star Wars - Circular Wipe Transition

Circular wipe transition of scenes.

Since the [`mask` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask) is not fully implemented across browsers, I looked for alternatives that have better support.

I created 2 versions:
1. CSS `clip-path` version: The [`clip-path`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) property is the basis of the animation. The transition edges are hard. You can see it in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/robjoeol/full/YzjQmoG).
1. SVG `mask` version: A SVG [`mask`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/mask) is used. The transition edges are soft. You can see it in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/robjoeol/full/dyjzvdb).

I discuss these implementations in the post - [An awesome, cross-browser Star Wars circular wipe transition? CSS houdini vs clippath vs mask](https://www.roboleary.net/css/2023/01/16/awesome-cross-browser-starwars-circular-wipe-transition-css-houdini-clipath-mask.html).

See ["star-wars-circular-wipe" folder](/star-wars-circular-wipe/) for code.

## Bubble text with image background

I wanted to see if I could create text with a background image and a stroked outline.

To achieve this, the following non-standard properties are required: `-webkit-background-clip: text` and `-webkit-text-stroke`.

You can check out the [codepen](https://codepen.io/robjoeol/full/OJwQYvy).

<img src="bubble-text-image-background/img/screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of miami text example of Bubble text with image background" width="545" height="292" loading="lazy"/>

See ["bubble-text-image-background" folder](/bubble-text-image-background/) for code.

## Framed content

I wanted to see if you can have content with a picture frame as a border. The border image should enclose the content whatever its dimensions.

I used the `border-image` family of properties. I use `border-image-repeat: repeat;` to handle when the width of the content is greater than the border image width. This degrades the image fidelity but in this case, it looks fine.

<img src="framed-content/img/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of content with a picture as border image" width="654" height="275" loading="lazy"/>

## Handpuppet blockquote

Have an image of a handpuppet affect the outline of a quotation. Uses `shape-outside` property.
