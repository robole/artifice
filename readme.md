# Artifice

 **ar•ti•fice** *är′tə-fĭs* ►

    n.
    Deception or trickery.
    n.
    Something contrived or made up to achieve an end, especially by deceiving; a stratagem or ruse: synonym: wile.

This is home to some (art) experiments to improve my frontend trickery.

Each experiment is organised into a folder. If the folder has:
- A subfolder with the title "original" - I recreated the original artwork in here (with a smidge of artistic license).
- A subfolder with the title "remix" -  this is where I go off and create my own thing.
- If there is neither of these subfolders, it's likely to be my own creation.

To try out the experiments, you can install the dependencies and run a local dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The default URL is <http://localhost:3000>. The default page (*index.html*) will outline the experiments with links to explore them
.

## Shiny book reveal

3D hover effect to open a book and reveal a synopsis of the story. I wanted to try out creating realistic reflections.

## Christmas Decoration

This an idea for a customisible Christmas decoration. It is like an accordian of cards. There are different designs on each side, you can fold them to create different combinations.

## Logo tilt

I wanted to try out a goofy idea. I wanted to animate a website’s logo so
that it would fall over when you scroll down, and right itself when you
scroll up. In particular, I wanted the logo to be a head or have a
cartoonish look.
