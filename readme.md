# Artifice

 **ar•ti•fice** *är′tə-fĭs* ►

    n.
    Deception or trickery.
    n.
    Something contrived or made up to achieve an end, especially by deceiving; a stratagem or ruse: synonym: wile.

This is home to (art) experiments to improve my web dev trickery.

The starting point is likely to be an artwork or graphic design.

Each experiment is organised into a folder. If the folder has:
- A subfolder with the title "original" - I created the original artwork in here (with some artistic license).
- A subfolder with the title "remix" -  this is where I go off and create my own thing.
- If there is neither of these subfolders, it's likely to be my own creation.
