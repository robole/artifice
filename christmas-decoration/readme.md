# Christmas Decoration

This an idea for a customisible decoration. It is like an accordian of cards. There are different designs on each side, you can fold them to create different combinations.

If you were to make this, you could take this further. You could create different slits to reveal different patterns. You could connect the cards with flaps on all sides permitting more permutations. And allow separate accordians to be combined also. It could be hung from the ceiling or placed on a table or mantelpiece.
