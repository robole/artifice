			<h1>The Handmaid's Tale</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals
				have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a
				feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned
				to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive
				Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the "morally fit" Wives. The tale is told by Offred
				(read: "of Fred"), a Handmaid who recalls the past and tells how the chilling society came to be.</p>
			<blockquote>“A novel that brilliantly illuminates some of the darker interconnections between politics and
				sex...just as the world of Orwell’s 1984 gripped our imaginations, so will the world of Atwood’s handmaid!”
				<br><i>Washington Post Book World</i></blockquote>
