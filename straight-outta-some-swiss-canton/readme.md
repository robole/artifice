# Straight Outta Some Swiss Canton

A poster for a NWA concert.

## Original

I changed the background colour, and used a different sans-serif typeface. Otherwise, it the same as the original!

## Remix

It features a pulsating police siren with accompanying sound effects!

Fitting for the world's most dangerous rap crew.

The code is available in the "remix" folder.

#### Lesson Learned

- The performance was a bit sluggish on mobile. To optimise it, I did the following:

  - Reduced the value of `perspective`.
  - Set the `will-change` property for the 3D transformations.  This lead to a decrease in the painting time by 85%.
